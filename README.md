# NutritionIQ
NutritionIQ is a receipt scanner with nutritional recommendations based on the items in the receipt. It was made in a team of 4 with Terrence Ho, David Lu, Rut Patel, and Ryan Kim for MHacks X (2017).

Built using the Google Cloud Platform (Storage, Machine-learning, Cloud Vision), Expo.io (React-Native), Node.js, Heroku, and NutritionIX.

## Inspiration
We wanted to utilize machine learning in order to get nutritional facts from a grocery receipt. We needed an easy way to get relevant nutritional facts about our grocery shopping trips, without having to look everything up individually.
## What it does
NutritionIQ uses Google Cloud Platform tools to get smart-data about items on a grocery receipt. No matter how long the grocery list, precise nutritional facts are displayed for every food item in order to help us make smart, conscious decisions about our daily nutrition.
## How I built it
To build it, we used Expo.io (Reactive-Native) to offer cross-platform mobile support. We used the Google Cloud Platform tools for our machine learning and part of our backend, and used Heroku with Node.js for the rest of our backend. NutritionIX API was used for up-to-date nutritional facts.
## Challenges I ran into
Some challenges we faced included:
1. Grocery receipts were not standardized amoung any grocery stores so we needed a way to parse the receipts in a way so that results were still consistent amoung different sellers. Also, a lot of items are abbreviated in Grocery receipts so searching up the exact item was hard.
2. ...
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We are proud that we integrated each part that we worked on into one big, working product.
